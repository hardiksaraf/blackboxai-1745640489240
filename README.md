# Project Name

## Project Overview
This project is a Django web application designed to facilitate administrative tasks through its command-line utility. The application is equipped with a management script, `manage.py`, which serves as the entry point for executing various Django commands.

## Installation
To get started with this Django project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
